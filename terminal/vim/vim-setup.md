# Setup

When you first link the vimrc file the plugins are not going to be installed

First run:

```
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

Then from a vim window, run:

```
:PlugInstall
```

Everything should no be working
